> Compare npm package source files minimaps

`mincmp` is one of those useless tool that allows you to compare the minimap of several package source files published on `npm`. It generates a `result.png` image with the aggregated source maps.

Have fun! :tada:

## Example

```sh
mincmp react/dist/react.min.js vue/dist/vue.min.js hyperapp/dist/hyperapp.js
```
